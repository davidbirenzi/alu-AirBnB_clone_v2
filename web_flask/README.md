# Web Flask

This directory contains Flask web application files for the AirBnB clone project. The Flask applications are used to create web routes and render HTML templates.

## Files

- `__init__.py`: Initializes the Flask application.
- `0-hello_route.py`: A simple Flask application that defines a route to display "Hello HBNB!".

## Usage

To run a Flask application, navigate to the `web_flask` directory and execute the Python file. For example:

```sh
python3 0-hello_route.py

The application will start a web server on 0.0.0.0 and port 5000. You can access the application by navigating to http://0.0.0.0:5000 in your web browser.

Routes
